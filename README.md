Coursera-Developing Data Products Assignment #3: Generating a Shiny Application

# DifferentialExpression Shiny App
This Shiny app was developed to interrogate & visualize differentially expression genes (DEGs) from a dataset of gene expression in a prostate cancer cell line treated with androgen (Dihydrotestosterone, DHT). The app allows the user to input a fold change and significance threshold, and generates a volcano plot depicting gene expression changes. DEGs defined by user inputs are highlighted on the plot. In addition, the number of up and downregulated genes defined by the user inputs is given.
